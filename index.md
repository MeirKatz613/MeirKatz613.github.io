# Meir's site

I started to really get into programming in my teenage years. I love the satisfaction of getting the code to work. I find there to be a certain addictiveness to programming. This site is a way of sharing my projects. 

## Gematria Calculator

This is one of my first real projects I've made, sure I've done the classic Hello World! excercise, but this is my first real, program, with a GUI. 

### How to download and use

Download the .zip folder containing both the executable and the JRE from my Google drive [here](
then unzip the folder. Then in the unzipped folder open the file gematriagui.exe. 
Type the Hebrew word you want the gematria of, then press enter, or the button that says 
Click for Gematria
Thats it.
