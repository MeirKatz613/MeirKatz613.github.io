## Gematria Calculator

This is one of my first real projects I've made, sure I've done the classic Hello World! excercise, but this is my first real, program, with a GUI. 

### How to download and use

Download the the executable from my Dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i146zlopxkrpc36/gematriagui.exe?dl=0)
then put into the same parent folder, of the appropriate JRE to go with it. In the case the JRE is zulu-16-jre, which you can download from [here](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu16.30.15-ca-jre16.0.1-win_x64.msi).
After installing the JRE, move both the JRE, and the executable into the same folder. Don't rename the JRE, just leave it as it is, otherwise the program won't work.
Double click the program to open.
Type the Hebrew word you want the gematria of, then press enter, or the button that says <br/>
Click for Gematria <br/>
Thats it.
